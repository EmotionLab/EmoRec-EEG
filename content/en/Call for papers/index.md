First Workshop on Generalizability of Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals at ACII’24

The first workshop on Generalizability of Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals (EmoRec EEG) at ACII’24 is designed to improve the comparability and generalizability of EEG emotion recognition approaches. We invite submissions on emotion recognition from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in two tracks:
1. Challenge Track: In this track, we invite submissions addressing at least one of two well-defined EEG emotion recognition tasks. Submissions in this track may either have the form of a full paper (max. 7 pages + 1 page for references) or of a short paper (max. 4 pages + 1 page for references). For both tasks, we provide a comprehensive software framework for user-friendly pre-processing, training, and evaluation. 
   - Person-dependent task: In this task, participants will develop models that are trained and tested on the data of a specific participant. All models will be evaluated on six major EEG emotion recognition datasets. 
   - Person-independent task: Here, participants will develop approaches for EEG emotion recognition that generalize across users. We provide train/test splits of 6 popular EEG emotion recognition datasets. During training, all datasets may be used jointly to improve performance.
      
2. Reflection Track: Here, we invite submissions concerned with the problem of generalizability of EEG emotion recognition. Both technical papers (max. 4 pages + 1 page for references) and position papers (max. 2 pages + 1 page for references) are possible. In contrast to the challenge track, the focus of technical papers is not to improve performance on the evaluation datasets, but to generate new insights into the problem. Evaluation on the challenge datasets is not required but will still be valued. Position papers may be concerned with all aspects pertaining to generalizability of EEG emotion recognition, including - but not limited to - evaluation protocols, data recording protocols, emotion elicitation techniques, EEG hardware considerations, and publishing bias.
